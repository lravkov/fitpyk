install gcc: https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/
add it to your path (the bin folder of what gets installed)
navigate to the folder where your C script is written in powershell
gcc <scriptName.c> --output <outputApplicationName>
now you can call the <outputApplicationName> from powershell or as a bash script
.\<outputApplicationName> <inputParams>
